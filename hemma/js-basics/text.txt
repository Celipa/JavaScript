Console.log works as print from python. It prints your code into the console.



let is a function that tells the code that ''let this letter mean this number'' as in ''let x mean 1''

if is a function you have worked with before in python, it tells you ''if the function is this.... do this.''


function myFunction() {
  let x = 1;              let x mean 1   
  if (true) {             if it's true
    let x = 2;            then let x equals 2
    console.log(x);       Then print output 2
  }
  console.log(x);         Then print output 1
}

myFunction();

// Hoisting not allowed
console.log(y); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y = 5;
